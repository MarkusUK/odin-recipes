Crumble in ground beef; cook and stir until no longer pink and completely cooked, 8 to 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Pour vinegar over ground beef mixture; simmer until liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar; bring to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, then remove from heat. Stir in basil .</li>
